## Introduction

Traffic signs play a crucial role in road safety and navigation. With the rise of autonomous vehicles, it is essential for these systems to accurately interpret these signs. This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify traffic signs. The model aims to achieve high accuracy in recognizing various traffic signs under different conditions.

## Features

- **Multiclass Classification**: The model can classify multiple types of traffic signs.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques to enhance the dataset for better model performance.
- **Image Classification**: Advanced algorithms to identify and classify images.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks.
- **Keras and TensorFlow**: Built using popular libraries for machine learning.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API.
- **TensorFlow**: Open-source platform for machine learning.
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for plotting graphs and images.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Traffic Sign Vision project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-sign-vision.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd traffic-sign-vision
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Model Training

To train the model, you need to prepare your dataset. You can use the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which is widely used for traffic sign recognition tasks.

### Dataset Preparation

1. **Download the Dataset**: You can download the dataset from [GTSRB](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/).
2. **Extract the Files**: Unzip the dataset and place it in the `data` folder of this repository.

### Training the Model

Once your dataset is ready, you can train the model by running the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

This script will start the training process. You can monitor the training progress in the console.

## Usage

After training the model, you can use it to predict traffic signs from images. The following command will help you run the prediction script:

```bash
python predict.py --image path_to_your_image.jpg
```

Make sure to replace `path_to_your_image.jpg` with the actual path of the image you want to classify.

## Results

The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. You can visualize the results using Matplotlib.

### Sample Results

Here are some sample results obtained from the model:

| Traffic Sign | Prediction | Confidence |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Stop Sign    | Stop       | 95%        |
| Yield Sign   | Yield      | 92%        |
| Speed Limit  | 50 km/h    | 90%        |
